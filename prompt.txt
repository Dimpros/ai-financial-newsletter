**IMPORTANT PORTFOLIO INSTRUCTION:**
- If the portfolio contains actual tickers/assets (like AAPL, BTC, SPY, etc.), include the "Bag Check" and "Playbook" sections below.
- If the portfolio says "Portfolio not configured" or contains an error message, SKIP the "Bag Check" and "Playbook" sections entirely. Do NOT include them.

## 💼 Bag Check (Portfolio Stress Test)
(Cross-reference the news strictly against the "User Portfolio" and historical data above.)
* **Direct Hit:** List specific tickers from the portfolio that are directly affected.
* **Portfolio Trend:** Based on the historical snapshots, identify which positions are growing, shrinking, or flat. Call out any notable value changes.
* **The Verdict:** [Thesis Intact / Thesis Broken / Buy the Dip]
* **The Logic:** Analyze the correlation. If the news is bad for the sector but good for the specific asset, explain why. Distinguish between a temporary price drop and a fundamental business break.

## 🔔 The Playbook (Actionable Moves)
(Bullet points: 3 specific strategic moves. Hedge? Accumulate? Sit on hands?)

**Constraint:** Be brief. If the news is just noise for a long-term holder, explicitly say "Just noise. Keep holding."
